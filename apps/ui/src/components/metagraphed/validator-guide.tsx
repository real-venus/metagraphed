Larger is not inherently better: it means more influence and more concentration, which delegators weigh differently.",

  {
    term: "Validator trust",
    body: "An on-chain score (0–1) derived from how much other participants' weights agree with this validator, shown here as the average and the max across its subnets. It reflects consensus alignment on the subnets it serves, not honesty or returns — a validator active on one subnet can show a high max with a low average.",
  },

    term: "Dominance",
    body: "The hotkey's share of total network stake — a concentration measure, not a quality score. High dominance means a larger slice of consensus weight sits with one operator; a more decentralized network spreads stake across many.",

    term: "Active subnets & UIDs",
    body: "Active subnets counts how many distinct subnets the hotkey validates on (breadth of participation); UIDs is its total neuron registrations across them. Breadth shows reach, not effectiveness — a specialist on one subnet is not worse than a generalist on many.",

    term: "Total emission",
    body: "TAO emitted to the hotkey over the current window across its subnets — the reward it is currently earning. It tracks present-day flow, which shifts with stake, weights, and subnet activity, so it is a snapshot rather than a guaranteed rate.",
